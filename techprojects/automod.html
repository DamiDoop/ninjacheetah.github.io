    <p>AutoMod is an application that installs a specific set of Minecraft mods I (will) use on my YouTube channel with my collaborators. It is currently a BATCH script that uses cURL to download a .rar archive from Dropbox that contains the mods. It then uses WinRAR (x64 only) and extracts it to the .minecraft/mods folder, before deleting the archive. I am currently working on a re-write of the program in C# using the .NET Framework. It will feature a full GUI and possibly more customization to the installation. The list of mods that it installs is available on the Wiki. Like every other program I've made, it's completely open source and all of the source code is available on the GitHub page. If you encounter any bugs while using the program, report them on the Issues page.</p>
