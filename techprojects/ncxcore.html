    <h1>Available through NCX-Installer: Technically Yes</h1>
    <p1>NCX-Core (originally NCX-Installer) is a Windows application for downloading and (where applicable) installing software made by me, or by other verified developers. It now features NCX-News, which can tell you when I've released updates to my programs. It can also now check for updates, meaning you know when there's a new update available. (This page is still a work in progress.)</p1>
