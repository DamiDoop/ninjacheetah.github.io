<h3>About</h3>
<p>fake-apt is my fake version of APT, the package manager used in Debian- and Ubuntu-based Linux distros.</p>
<p>fake-apt sets out to imitate most of APT's features, such as <code>install</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>remove</code>, etc. While it's meant to look like the program is doing something, it doesn't really do anything, and is just for looks.</p>
<h3>Platform Support</h3>
<p>fake-apt is one of the only completely cross-platform apps that I've written. Windows support has taken considerably more work to maintain than macOS and Linux support, but as I'm creating this page all platforms are still supported.</p>
<h3>Making it Seem Real</h3>
<p>Making fake-apt seem convincing was something I really wanted to achieve. In the original .NET version and early C versions, a fake prompt would be shown that would change based on your OS. In more recent versions, I made the executable take arguments directly, so you can use your real prompt and real password prompt to make it seem more real. On any non-Debian/non-Ubuntu systems (macOS included), you can rename the binary to <code>apt</code> and put it in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> and run it exactly how you would run the real APT.</p>
<h3>Ports</h3>
<p>In March 2021, GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/LinUwUxCat">LinUwUxCat</a> ported fake-apt to C++, and to the 3DS. The C++ version can be run the same way as the C version, and the 3DS version is compiled as a 3DSX file and can be run on a modded 3DS or in a 3DS emulator. You can find this port <a href="https://github.com/LinUwUxCat/fake-apt">here</a>. (Note that it is a little outdated now.)</p>
