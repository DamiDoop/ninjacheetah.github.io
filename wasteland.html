            <h1>Wasteland</h1>
            <h2>Wasteland was a collaborative effort with myself, Leo the Lion, MintBranch99035 owo, and GJKweens. We were in a ruined version of the world we often play in, which is infested with zombies and has radiation in the air. Sadly nobody was interested in this series, and it was discontinued after just one episode, and the second was never released.</h2>
            <h3>Reason for discontinuation: Lack of intrest from viewers and collaborators</h3>
            <p>Only Episode (Second episode was recoreded but never posted)</p>
