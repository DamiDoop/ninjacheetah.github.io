    <p>The CSharp Collection is a project that was a continuation of The Visual Basic Collection Volume 1, which I stopped work on in favor of using C# over Visual Basic. It was created as a way to learn C# and to have fun with it! It's made up of smaller programs that are all part of it.</p>
    <h1>Programs included:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Color Buttons</li>
        <li>C#Calc</li>
        <li>Tic Tac No</li>
        <li>C#Notes</li>
        <li>C#Seach</li>
    </ul>
