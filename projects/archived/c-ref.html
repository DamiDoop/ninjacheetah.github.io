<h2>About</h2>
<p>c-ref was my attempt at a reference guide for the C programming language. Its goal was to be as simple to understand as possible while still telling you what you need to know to make things work. The biggest flaw was that I was trying to teach what I was just learning (sometimes incorrectly), and that the site itself was clunky to navigate.</p>
<p>The repository was silently archived down on March 15, and while the site itself can be viewed and stumbled through at <a href="https://ninjacheetah.github.io/c-ref/">https://ninjacheetah.github.io/c-ref/</a>, the domain, <code>c-ref.ncxprogramming.com</code>, is now disabled. No future work will be done on the site and the project is unlikely to be revisted as there are plenty of other reference sites out there.</p>
<p><b>Fun Fact:</b></p>
<p>The site was modeled after Nintendo's internal reference documentations. How I know what that looks like will not be discussed.</p>
